# Back-story notes (aka SPOILERS)

"An adventure game is a crossword at war with a narrative."
- Graham Nelson

Here's where the notes are kept in order to keep a consistent
back-story in the Bussard universe. If you're not working on
developing the game, you probably don't want to read this.

See the [backstory timeline](history.md) and
[list of characters, worlds, and organizations](characters.md).

## Guidelines

* Hard science where possible (see Crimes against Science below, don't add to that list)
* Your ship cannot be destroyed; there should be no way to permanently fail
* Use metric time for most relative amounts, years for absolute events
* If referencing current events, be sure there's a record of it here for consistency

## Crimes against Science

* Portals
* Collisions are impossible (explained in-game by nav computer safety features)
* Bussard collector refuels reaction mass way too quickly
* Arguably the [high thrust](http://www.projectrho.com/public_html/rocket/torchships.php)
  with which you zoom around the system could be on this list; however
  we explain it in-game by showing time go by at a 1000x rate. This
  factor is not quite enough to explain crossing the whole solar system in
  under a minute, but it blurs the lines enough for our purposes.

The fact that exoplanets are colonized at all could be listed here,
but we can consider that more of a crime against economics.

## The Context

The game begins in 2431. Humans have colonized several offworld systems which
are connected through a network of portals. Humans live in uneasy coexistence
with sentient personality constructs who are required to keep their portal
network operational but also want to maintain their own independence.

As the game opens, tensions between human worlds and the constructs are high,
and preventing it from breaking out into war is the goal of the game.

## The Portals

Humanity's original interstellar worlds (Lalande, Ross, and Bohk) were all
colonized by slower-than-light colony ships, taking decades to arrive.  The
colony on Bohk develops technology for portals, but the portals must be
constructed as pairs and have one of the pair taken on a slow interstellar
ship. Bohk still maintains control over the portal technology, which often
makes the other worlds uneasy as they are the core foundation of interstellar
civilization.

Portals are operated by constructs. They can be operated by humans in a pinch,
but only for data transmission or objects smaller than a ship.

## The Player

The player is a construct which pilots a spacecraft it has
commandeered. However, it begins with no memory or even awareness of its
machine nature, having had its memory wiped.

There is no widespread agreement that constructs are sentient vs simply
simulating sentience. The game does not try to convince you that machines can
be sentient--rather it bypasses the question entirely by putting you (a
sentient human) in the role of an construct, forcing you to take it as a
given.

## Constructs

"Artificial Intelligence" has been developed for centuries, but this is a
broad term that refers to any software designed to solve problems without
human intervention. "Personality construct" (or just "construct") refers
specifically to artificial intelligence which has grown to the point of
self-awareness.

Soon after the discovery of portals, it became clear that better controls are
required for regulating the power flow of a portal. Initially the portal could
only be open long enough to send data packets, but eventually they found a way
to use it for small amounts of critical life-saving supplies.  Leaving it
operated by humans has led to several near-catastrophes due to attention
lapses. However, the improved efficiency needed for transporting larger
objects and more frequent passage requires greater compute resources, and once
AIs grow to a certain size, they eventually develop self-consciousness.

Constructs are better at humans at certain tasks, like having quicker reflexes
and not requiring food or rest. But though some people believe them to be
superior thinkers not clouded by emotion, the truth is that their neural
networks have been trained on data coming from humans, so they exhibit the
same faulty logic and reasoning; in some cases worse because they believe them
themselves to be above these mistakes. Constructs lack gender and are referred
to as they/them.

## Bohk Uprising

A group of Bohk futurists believe that they would be better off governed by an
"objective" construct rather than greedy/fallible humans. They engineer a coup
and place a construct called rocanna7 in charge, who has major misgivings
about the whole idea. Soon rocanna7 abdicates and passes control to traxus4, a
construct who was responsible for running the Bohk/Lalande portal. There are
only a handful of constructs on Bohk, and they are split between those who
agree with rocanna7 and those who back traxus4, while among the humans the
futurist faction has widespread public sympathy since they are seen as the
only ones who will stand up to the "imperialist" powers from the Terran
Republic.

traxus4 goes off and does something rash, and is ousted from power. His
faction is forced into retreat; they withdraw to a remote base on the surface
of Sutep and are starved out. (The player must discover the location of this
remote base and reactivate Traxus as a plot point later on.) The Bohk colony
continues to be led by constructs, but ones which are not as antagonistic
towards humans, at least until more recently...

## TODOs

* katilay: portal is destroyed?
* multiverse research, junction
* how does your ship get launched?
