# Companion Characters

Your only interaction with these characters is by email. They can
email you when certain plot points trigger (or maybe after a certain
amount of time has passed with no plot points triggering in the case
of hints) but you can't email them back beyond simple OK/NO replies.

## dex19

A curious little construct. Travels with you thru the whole (?) game.

## Nim Pattachoti (นิมปัตตะโชติ) <nim.pattachoti@starlink.net>

She is an older freelance repair tech with an amateur interest in
historical computing. Gruff but kind at heart. She and dex19 used to work
together in the past, but their partnership ran into some problems, and she
just wants to be left alone with her family now.

Named after Sarit Pattachoti (https://www.nectec.or.th/it-standards/keyboard_layout/thai-key.html)

## rocanna7

A construct who is somewhat elusive, having abdicated rulership of Bohk.

## traxus4

A construct who was ousted from ruling Bohk due to unchecked aggression, some
in Bohk wish for traxus4 to return.

# Systems by Government

Each world has a file in data/motd which contains a brief description and is
shown when logging into that world.

## Solar Union

Home of humanity, but regressed from its height. Suffered from having portal
delayed due to accident. Sol is ancient, and still hosts the majority of
humankind, many of whom have never left Earth. Many living elsewhere see it as
backwards or quaint.

* Earth
* Mars
* Newton Station
* Nee Soon Station

## Terran Republic

Most wealthy and powerful, but only controls two systems, Lalande and
Ross. Formerly included Sol. Regulates portal technology.

* Sungai (Lalande)
* Bendera (Lalande)
* Kuching Station (Ross)

## Principality of Istana

Independent station in a Terran system (Ross). Grandfathered into
independence early on. Isolated, wealthy, and small.

* Istana (Ross)

## Kingdom of Bohk

Due to a lack of communication, developed fairly independently from
the Terran Republic. Bohk is ruled by a majority of constructs, but it is the
only place where they are allowed any form of authority.

* Bohk Prime
* Warnabu Station
* Changlun (New Phobos)
* Sutep (New Phobos)
* Rimoei (Mecalle)

## Republic of Katilay

Conflict-wracked even within a single system. Portal was faulty upon
arrival; contact with Lalande only recently re-established. The core world
prejudices against constructs aren't commonplace here.

* Katilay Prime
* Mogok Station

## Tana Protectorates

Newest government, close ties still to Solar Union. Rich in minerals. Terrans
allow Sol to operate portals keeping Tana running, but Tana is completely
dependent upon Sol for food and transport, leaving it quite vulnerable.

* Kota Baru (Tana)
* Malioboro (Tana)
* Telemoyo Station (Tana)
* Solotogo (Wolf 294)
* Kembali Station (Luyten)
* Merdeka Station (L 668-21)

Tana has the most worlds, but the smallest population.

## Inhabited Worlds League

Originally the Terran Republic covered all inhabited worlds, but as new
colonies sprung up independently or declared independence, the League has held
things together. They oversee trade agreements, enact spaceflight safety
regulations, administrate a unified currency, coordinate exploration efforts,
and work to protect peace. Nominally they aim to advance shared scientific
progress, but little of this happens in practice.

# Companies

* Ceres Shipyards (Sol)
  Responsible for all early long-haul colony ships and all Tana
  ones. All long-haul cargo ships made here. Located in the asteroid
  belt.

* Songket Shipyards (Lalande)
  Responsible for most later colony ships, but also creates many
  interplanetary cargo ships.

* Kosaga Shipyards (small, Bohk)
  Started in order to create the New Phobos colony ship, but now only
  focuses on interplanetary ships.

* Ares Mineral Company (Lalande)
  Dominant mining company.

* Starlink (Sol)
  An ISP. (starlink.net)

* WonderChannel
  Another ISP. (wonderchannel.net)

* Aperture Technology (Bohk)
  Caretaker of portal artifacts, researches and maintains portal
  technology. Closely guards what little they know of how they work.

* Interstellar Communication Systems (Lalande)
  Works with Aperture to piggy-back data transmission on top of each
  portal open cycle.

* Consolidated Mineral Exploitation Company (Tana)
  The primary driver behind the colonization of Tana and the largest chunk of
  its economy.

* Orolo Research (Sol)
  Responsible for early sublight drives, recently assisting Luminous
  with coldsleep research.

* Free Infrastructure Foundation (Istana)
  Responsible for maintaining software infrastructure such as the Orb OS.

# Spaceships

## Early Interplanetary ships

## Colonizers

Self-sufficient ships with crews numbering in the mid-hundreds. Upon
arrival the ships are disassembled and the parts used to construct
either planetary colonies or re-appropriated into orbital stations.

* First Wave: SS Lorentz (Lalande, 0.3c), SS Copernicus (Ross, 0.5c)
* Second Wave: SS Bradbury (Bohk, 0.6c),
  SS Eratosthenes † (New Phobos, 0.5c)
* Third Wave: SS Kepler † (Kowlu)
* Fourth Wave: SS Las Casas (Katilay), SS Cherenkov † (Mecalle),
  SS Sagan (Delta Pavonis)
* Fifth Wave: SS Pythagoras (Luyten), SS Planck (Tana),
  SS Rosen (Wolf), SS Archimedes (L 668-21)

† - ship from Bohk

From third-wave on they all have portals onboard and fly at 0.7c.

## Portal ships

Newer colonizers have portals on them, but existing colonies need
ships containing just the equipment needed to create the portal.

* Second portal ship: SS Euclid
 * Lalande->Ross
 * Bohk->New Phobos
 * Mecalle->Katilay
* Ptolemy Rescue ship: SS Goddard
* Bohk trade ship: SS Oberth

## Modern Interplanetary ships

Engines capable of lots of maneuvering around a star but not long-term
flight. They need significant battery if they are to activate a
portal. Mostly they carry cargo and passengers; occasionally
scientific equipment.

## Non-colonizing exploration ships? (automated?)

# Gutenberg Liberation Front

The Gutenberg Liberation Front is protesting the extension of
copyright term. They do this by posting chapters of public-domain
works into random news groups. Some of the works they use:

* The Man who was Thursday
* Meditations on Moloch
* The Song of Roland
* Some Doctorow novel?
* Shakespeare?
* The Grand Inquisitor by Dostoyevsky
* Kierkegaard?
* Leiningen vs the Ants?
