Welcome to Mogok Station, founded 2348.

Mogok Station was founded in the last century by the crew of the
colony ship SS Pythagoras. Launched from Lalande, they ran into
trouble when they arrived at their destination with an inoperable
portal. Determined to stand by their duty even when the colonists
insisted on attempting a return voyage, they put down an uprising and
converted the colony ship into what is now called Mogok Station.

Eventually a second colony ship was able to re-establish contact
between the Katilay system and the rest of the portal network, but
Mogok Station is still a small, out-of-the-way port.
