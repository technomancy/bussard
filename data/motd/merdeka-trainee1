Welcome to stage 1 of the CMEC bot operations training course.

You are currently logged into an indoor training rover. Anything you type here
is run in the context of the rover, which accepts Forth code. Your goal is to
pilot the rover (which is red) next to the terminal on the other side of the
room, marked with ">_".

You can execute any kind of code you want including numeric calculations or
defining functions, but you will be most interested in calling the functions
`forward`, `left`, and `right` to move the rover around.
