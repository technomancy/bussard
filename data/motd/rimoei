Welcome to Rimoei, trade outpost in Mecalle, founded 2351.

When the Mecalle system was colonized, it was thought that trade with
Katilay and colonies beyond would form an important part of its
economy. When the Katilay colonies ran into trouble, this lucrative
route never materialized, but the colonists are happy to be left
alone. Many of the Katilay colonists resettled here looking for a
better life after the portal was re-established.

As Katilay's entry into the Inhabited Worlds League happened only
recently, much of the trade that did pass through Rimoei up until
then was in black-market goods. While smuggling levels dropped when
the laws of the League took effect in Katilay, its legacy lingers.
