Welcome to Katilay Prime, founded 2349.

Katilay Prime is a small colony still recovering from the devastating
effects of civil war in the last century.

The Katilay system was colonized in the 24th century, but the portal
carried by the colony ship proved unstable, and the colonists were
unable to establish communication or transit to any other worlds upon
arrival. Fearing for the long-term survival of the colonization
effort, the colonists wished to turn the ship around and get back to
civilization, but the crew refused and banished the colonists to the
surface, eventually turning to outright hostilities and a decade-long
civil war that was only resolved by the re-establishment of portal
contact with other worlds.

Towns on the planet were kept small and spread out across the planet
due to attacks from the orbiting colony ship, which was converted into 
Mogok Station. Though peace has held for many years, infrastructure
still remains minimal and poorly-maintained.

Katilay has been a member of the Inhabited Worlds League since 2385.
