Welcome to Malioboro, breadbasket of Tana, founded 2412.

Malioboro is a world whose economy revolves mostly around growing
food. Ten years after Kota Baru was settled, a desire to reduce their
dependence upon Sol led them to found a colony here. Though the
atmosphere is not hospitable to humans, the oceans support rich
growths of algae, which is crucial to the food supply of Tana's
worlds.

The Tana system is also home to Kota Baru and Telemoyo Station.
