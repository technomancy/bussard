Welcome to Bohk Prime, capital of the Kingdom of Bohk, established 2187.

While Bohk Prime is not humanity's oldest extrasolar colony, it was
the first to become independent from the Terran Republic. This
happened not through some fierce revolution or cutthroat subterfuge,
but simply because the effects of distance in the pre-portal era
proved too great for Sol to maintain a hold over Bohk, eventually
allowing it to develop into an independent Kingdom ruled by a
well-loved monarch.

Bohk Prime contains the seat of the monarchy; ruling over five worlds
across three star systems.
